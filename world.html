        <img style = "float:right; height:150px;"src="frenchInAfrica.jpg" alt="France controled parts of africa 1919-1939.">
        <p>The French had the largest colonial empire in Africa, over 3 1‚ÅÑ2 million square miles, half of which contained the Sahara Desert. In 1830, France had conquered Algeria in North Africa. Between 1881 and 1912, France acquired Tunisia, Morocco, West Africa, and Equatorial Africa. <strong>At its height, the French Empire in Africa was as large as the continental United States.</strong></p>
        <h2 id = "great-britain">Great Britain</h2>
        <p><strong>Britain‚Äôs holdings in Africa were not as large as France‚Äôs but it controlled the more populated regions, particularly of southern Africa, which contained <em>valuable mineral resources such as diamonds and gold.</em></strong> In 1806, the British displaced Holland in South Africa and ruled the Cape Colony. However, the British soon came into conflict with the Boers (farmers), the original Dutch settlers who resented British rule. In the 1830s, the Boers left British territory, migrated north, and founded two republics‚Äîthe Orange Free State and Transvaal. The Boers soon came into conflict with the powerful Zulus, a native-African ethnic group, for control of the land. When the Zulus and the Boers were unable to win a decisive victory, the British became involved in The Zulu Wars and eventually destroyed the Zulu empire. In 1890, Cecil Rhodes (1853‚Äì1902), who was born in Great Britain and had become a diamond mine millionaire, became prime minister of the Cape Colony. He wanted to extend the British African Empire from Cape Town to Cairo and decided to annex the Boer Republic. In the Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), the British, with great difficulty, defeated the Boers and annexed the two republics. In 1910, Britain combined its South African colonies into the Union of South Africa. Whites ran the government, and the Boers, who outnumbered the British, assumed control. This system laid the foundation for racial segregation that would last until the 1990s.</p>
        <h2 id = "germany">Germany</h2>
        <p>Late unification delayed Germany‚Äôs imperialistic ventures, but it also wanted its place in the sun. Germany took land in eastern and southwestern Africa.</p>
        <h2 id = "italy">Italy</h2>
        <p>Italy was another late entry into the imperialistic venture. Italy took control of Libya, Italian Somaliland, and Eritrea, which is the north-most province of Ethiopia, near the Red Sea. Italy‚Äôs efforts to gain control of Ethiopia ended in bitter defeat.</p>
        <h2 id = "portugal">Portugal</h2>
        <p>Portugal carved out large colonies in Angola and Mozambique.</p>
        <h2 id = "india">India</h2>
        <p>The British took control of India in 1763, after defeating the French in the Seven Years‚Äô War (1756‚Äì1763). The British controlled India through the British East India Company, which ruled with an iron hand. In 1857, an Indian revolt, led by native soldiers called sepoys, led to an uprising known as the Sepoy Mutiny. After suppressing the rebellion, the British government made India part of the empire in 1858, as mentioned previously. The British introduced social reforms, advocated education, and promoted technology. Britain profited greatly from India, which was called the ‚ÄúCrown Jewel of the British Empire.‚Äù The Indian masses, however, continued to live close to starvation and the British had little respect for the native Indian culture.</p>
        <p>The Dutch held the Dutch East Indies and extended their control over Indonesia, while the French took over Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The Russians also got involved and extended their control over the area of Persia (Iran).</p>
        <h2 id = "china">China</h2>
        <img style = "float: left; height:300px; margin: 8px;"src="chinaImperialism.jpeg" alt="chinese looking over white men">
        <p>Since the seventeenth century, China had isolated itself from the rest of the world and refused to adopt Western ways. The Chinese permitted trade but only at the Port of Canton, where the rights of European merchants were at the whim of the emperor. Imperialism in China began with the First Opium War (1839‚Äì1842), when the Chinese government tried to halt the British from importing opium. This resulted in a war in which Britain‚Äôs superior military and industrial might easily destroyed the Chinese military forces. The Treaty of Nanking (1842) opened up five ports to the British, gave Britain the island of Hong Kong, and forced China to pay a large indemnity. In 1858, China was forced to open up eleven more treaty ports that granted special privileges, such as the right to trade with the interior of China and the right to supervise the Chinese custom offices. Foreigners also received the right of extraterritoriality, which meant that Western nations maintained their own courts in China and Westerners were tried in their own courts. </p>
        <p>Between 1870 and 1914, the Western nations carved China into spheres of influence, areas in which outside powers claimed exclusive trading rights. France acquired territory in southwestern China, Germany gained the Shandong Peninsula in northern China, Russia obtained control of Manchuria and a leasehold over Port Arthur, and the British took control of the Yangzi valley. The United States, which had not taken part in carving up China because it feared that spheres of influence might hurt U.S. commerce, promoted the Open Door Policy in 1899. John Hay, the American Secretary of State, proposed that equal trading rights to China be allowed for all nations and that the territorial integrity of China be respected. The imperial nations accepted this policy in principle but not always in practice. For the United States, however, the Open Door Policy became the cornerstone of its Chinese policy at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
        <p>By the 1900s, China was in turmoil. There was rising sentiment against foreigners because China had been forced to give up so many political and economic rights. This anti-foreign sentiment exploded into the Boxer Rebellion or Uprising (1899‚Äì1901). The Boxers were a secret Chinese nationalist society supported by the Manchu government, and their goal was to drive out all foreigners and restore China to isolation. In June 1900, the Boxers launched a series of attacks against foreigners and Chinese Christians. They also attacked the foreign embassies in Beijing. The imperialistic powers sent an international force of 25,000 troops to crush the rebellion, which ended within two weeks.</p>
        <p>The Boxer Rebellion failed, but it convinced the Chinese that reforms were necessary. In 1911, revolutions broke out across the country and the Manchu emperor was overthrown. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen (1866‚Äì1925), the father of modern China, proclaimed a republic and was named the new president. He advocated a three-point program of nationalism (freeing China from imperial control); democracy (elected government officials); and livelihood (adapting Western industrial and agricultural methods). The Chinese republic faced many problems and for the next thirty-seven years, China would continue to be at war with itself and with foreign invaders.</p>

        <h2 id = "japan">Japan</h2>
        <p>Japan was the only Asian country that did not become a victim of imperialism. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Japanese expelled Europeans from Japan and closed Japanese ports to trade with the outside world, allowing only the Dutch to trade at Nagasaki. In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry (1866‚Äì1925), an American naval officer, led an expedition to Japan. He convinced the shogun, a medieval-type ruler, to open ports for trade with the United States. Fearful of domination by foreign countries, Japan, unlike China, reversed its policy of isolation and began to modernize by borrowing from the West. The Meiji Restoration, which began in 1867, sought to replace the feudal rulers, or the shogun, and increase the power of the emperor. The goal was to make Japan strong enough to compete with the West. The new leaders strengthened the military and transformed Japan into an industrial society. The Japanese adopted a constitution based on the Prussian model with the emperor as the head. The government was not intended to promote democracy but to unite Japan and make it equal to the West. The leaders built up a modern army based on a draft and constructed a fleet of iron steamships.</p>
        <p>The Japanese were so successful that they became an imperial power. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95, Japan defeated China and forced her to give up her claims in Korea. Japan also gained control of its first colonies‚ÄîTaiwan and the Pescadores Islands‚Äîand shocked the world by defeating Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. Japan‚Äôs victory was the first time that an Asian country had defeated a European power in over 200 years.</p>
